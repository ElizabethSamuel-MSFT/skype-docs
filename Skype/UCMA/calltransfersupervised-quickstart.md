# CallTransferSupervised (QuickStart)

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

**Sample name**: CallTransferSupervised

**Sample location**: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 5.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\CallTransferSupervised

## Description

The application represents three users, referred to in this description as transferee, transferor, and transfer target. The transferor places audio calls to both transferee and transfer target. After the calls are accepted and connect successfully, the transferor executes a supervised transfer from transferee to the transfer target. In doing so, the original calls that the transferor had with the transferee and transfer target are terminated, and a new call directly between transferee and transfer target is established. The transferor then drops out of the communication. The application prints log messages to the console, and then quits, shutting down the platform normally.

## Features

  - Call transfer and established call activities

  - Basic call placement

  - Basic incoming audio/video call use
