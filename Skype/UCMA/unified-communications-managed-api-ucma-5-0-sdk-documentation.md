# Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 5.0 SDK documentation

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 enables developers to build applications that leverage the full power of the platform. Applications built on UCMA 5.0 incorporate unified communications concepts such as presence, call, conversation, and conference.

Because UCMA 5.0 applications are software-based, rather than hardware-based, it is easier to add and customize communication and collaboration features. These applications can satisfy the needs of your users and the specific requirements of your company, and meet industry- and organization-specific needs.

## Communications scenarios

UCMA 5.0 is an especially good fit for the following communications scenarios:

- Sophisticated contact center or help desk scenarios, such as those that use interactive voice response (IVR), automated call distribution (ACD), and call-recording. Other scenarios include web chat, query response bots, and conferencing and application sharing.

- Applications that access unified communications-enabled services from any phone with a single login to enable connecting to your online meeting through a simple spoken command, checking for new SharePoint tasks, or having your Microsoft Exchange email read to you, all in the same call.

- IVR applications authored in VoiceXML.

## Important attributes

UCMA 5.0 is a C\# API that includes development and runtime components. UCMA 5.0 makes it easy for developers to develop powerful communication solutions for the Enterprise.

The following are the most important attributes of UCMA 5.0:

- **Powerful**
    
  UCMA 5.0 trusted services can use elevated permissions to impersonate users, join conferences invisibly, and control audio mixing.

- **Scalable**
    
  UCMA 5.0 trusted services can handle thousands of concurrent Instant Messaging communications and can scale out by adding more application hosts.

- **Reliable**
    
  UCMA 5.0 trusted services are resilient to intermediate hop failures, offer best-of-breed voice quality, speech recognition and speech synthesis, and support DNS-based load-balancing and failover.

- **Industry standards-friendly**
    
  UCMA 5.0 eases the migration from traditional telephony to Skype for Business Server 2015 as it interoperates directly with most SIP PSTN gateways and IP-PBXs for common telephony scenarios. UCMA 5.0 also provides support for Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) 2.0 for speech-based applications.

- **Extensible**
    
  The UCMA 5.0 built-in extensibility provides for a broad range of scenarios that use custom media and call types.
