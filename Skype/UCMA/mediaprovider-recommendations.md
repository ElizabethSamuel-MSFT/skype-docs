# MediaProvider recommendations


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

To implement bandwidth management in a class derived from the [MediaProvider](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.componentmodel.mediaprovider) class, the derived provider class must carry out the following tasks:

- Honor the bandwidth policy-check flag provided by the base media provider to determine whether a bandwidth check should be performed.

- On the answerer side, if the bandwidth check returns with a call-redirect message, throw [OfferAnswerException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382722\(v=office.16\)) with an [OfferAnswerFailureReason](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh348371\(v=office.16\)) value of **RedirectDueToBandwidthPolicy**.
    
  If the bandwidth check returns with a call-fail message, throw [OfferAnswerException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382722\(v=office.16\)) with an [OfferAnswerFailureReason](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh348371\(v=office.16\)) value of **FailDueToBandwidthPolicy**.
    
  > [!NOTE]
  > Even though a media provider returns **RedirectDueToBandwidthPolicy**, the signaling layer can override this value and terminate the call with a failure response code based on application preferences.

- In the event of a partial failure, populate the appropriate headers in the 200 OK message if some of the modalities were rejected due to bandwidth policy check.

- Provide a way to inform the application of partial failures through MediaFlow.

- Provide a way to inform the application of RE-INVITE bandwidth failures through MediaFlow.

- On the offerer side, be prepared to handle a null answer with an [SdpAnswerStatus](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh383245\(v=office.16\)) value of **NotAcceptableDueToBandwidthPolicy** when the answerer rejects the call with a 488 status code.

- (Optional) In **FlowConfigurationRequested** event, expose a way to get application preferences on enabling and disabling bandwidth policy.
