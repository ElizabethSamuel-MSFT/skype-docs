# Collaboration layer

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

This section provides information about the parts of Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 that are associated with text and audio communications, presence, and audio devices. The collaboration layer can be thought of as being made up of two major components: a group of classes that enable communication between endpoints; and a group of classes that enable presence subscription and publication, and manage contacts and contact groups. The first illustration shows the principal classes that are used in communication, divided into groups with a common theme.
