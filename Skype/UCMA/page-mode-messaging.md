# Page-mode messaging


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

In UCMA 5.0, an endpoint can send messages to another endpoint without establishing a signaling session. An operation of this type is referred to as *page-mode messaging*. In page mode, a message is delivered from the source to the target without a handshake being required between the two endpoints. UCMA 5.0 exposes the [SendMessage()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh350225\(v=office.16\)) overloaded methods for sending a page-mode message synchronously, and the [BeginSendMessage()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349151\(v=office.16\)) overloaded methods and the [EndSendMessage(IAsyncResult)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382471\(v=office.16\)) method for sending a page-mode message asynchronously.

The recipient of a page-mode message must subscribe to the [MessageReceived](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh350010\(v=office.16\)) event in order to receive this type of message.

For more information, see [Sending and receiving page-mode messages](sending-and-receiving-page-mode-messages.md).
