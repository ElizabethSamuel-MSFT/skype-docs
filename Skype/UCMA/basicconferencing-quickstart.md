# BasicConferencing (QuickStart)


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015



**Sample name**: BasicConferencing

**Sample location**: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 5.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\BasicConferencing

## Description

The application initializes a platform and two endpoints, caller and callee, each on behalf of a different user. The caller endpoint schedules an IM conference using the conference scheduling APIs, and then both the caller and the callee join this scheduled conference. This sample also expects a third user to be logged in to a client (Skype for Business 2015) who will be extended an invitation to participate in the conference. This way, you can get a visual representation of the IM conference and the roster. The end result is that you have three users in an IM conference with each other.

The caller endpoint sends an IM on the conference, which all three endpoints receive. The callee endpoint always echoes all messages sent by caller endpoint. All messages sent by the caller endpoint and callee endpoint are always logged to the console. The third endpoint, logged in to Skype for Business 2015, can terminate the conference by sending a "bye" message, which in turn shuts down the platform normally.
