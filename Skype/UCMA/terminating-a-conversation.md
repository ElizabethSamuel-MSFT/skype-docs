# Terminating a conversation


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

The recommended way for an application can terminate a conversation is as follows, by calling one of the [BeginTerminate()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349607\(v=office.16\)) overloaded methods on the [Conversation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349224\(v=office.16\)) instance.

The following code example demonstrates terminating an existing conversation.

```csharp
Conversation conversation = new Conversation(endpoint);
...
conversation.BeginTerminate(Conversation_TerminateCompleted, conversation);

void Conversation_TerminateCompleted(IAsyncResult asyncResult)
{
    Conversation conversation = asyncResult.AsyncState as Conversation;
    conversation.EndTerminate(asyncResult);    // Should not throw.
}
```
