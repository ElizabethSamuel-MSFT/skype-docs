# VoiceXML 2.0 support

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 supports Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications authored with the industry-standard VoiceXML markup language. You can create .NET applications that host local or remote VoiceXML-based IVR applications in UCMA 5.0. You can also migrate existing VoiceXML applications that might have been running on other platforms, to UCMA 5.0.

A hosting .NET application authored in UCMA 5.0 can process the markup language in VoiceXML applications. UCMA 5.0 gives VoiceXML applications access to telephony and audio functionality that facilitates automated communication with callers.

For more information, see [VoiceXML support in UCMA 5.0](voicexml-support-in-ucma-5-0.md).
