# Endpoint services


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

The endpoint (an [ApplicationEndpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.applicationendpoint?view=ucma-api) or [UserEndpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.userendpoint?view=ucma-api) instance) plays a central role in Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 because of the access it provides to the communication and collaboration infrastructure.

After a [CollaborationPlatform](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.collaborationplatform?view=ucma-api) instance is created, it can be used to create one or more endpoints. An endpoint can then be used to create a conversation, schedule an upcoming conference, publish presence information to others, subscribe to the presence of other parties, manage your contacts, or collect related contacts into groups.

## Communication framework

The communication framework can be used to create conversations or to schedule and manage an upcoming conference.

### Conversations

An endpoint owner (the endpoint’s local owner) can use it to create multiple conversations ([Conversation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349224\(v=office.16\)) instances), where each conversation can have one or more remote participants, and can use a single media mode (such as instant message) or use multiple media modes (such as instant message and audio). For more information, see Conversation.

### Conference management

An endpoint’s access to a [ConferenceServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh348907\(v=office.16\)) instance makes it possible for the organizer of a conference to schedule, update, or cancel a conference, and carry out other operations in advance of a conference. For more information, see [Conference scheduling and management](conference-scheduling-and-management.md) and [ConferenceServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd279792\(v=office.16\)).

## Collaboration framework

The collaboration framework represents the functionality that can be used to convey the presence information of a presentity to others, get the presence information of remote participants, manage contacts, and organize contacts into meaningful groups.

### Presence publishing

An endpoint provides access to a [LocalEndpointPresenceServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh350157\(v=office.16\)) instance and a [LocalOwnerPresence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382370\(v=office.16\)) instance, which enable an endpoint’s local owner to publish presence information, acknowledge subscriptions requests from remote participants, and carry out related operation. For more information, see [Presence - self and remote](presence-self-and-remote.md), Publishing Presence, and [LocalOwnerPresence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd279776\(v=office.16\)).

### Presence subscription

An endpoint also provides access to a [RemotePresence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349758\(v=office.16\)) instance. The local owner of the endpoint can use this object to subscribe to the presence information of remote presentities. For more information, see [Presence - self and remote](presence-self-and-remote.md), [Subscribing to Presence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd280151\(v=office.16\)), and [RemotePresence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd280143\(v=office.16\)).

### Contacts and groups

**UserEndpoint** instances (but not **ApplicationEndpoint** instances) have access to a [ContactGroupServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381099\(v=office.16\)) instance. This access makes it possible to add, update, or delete a contact, add, update, or delete a group, and carry out other operations on contacts or groups. For more information, see [Contacts and groups](contacts-and-groups.md) and [ContactGroupServices](contactgroupservices.md).
