# Audio devices (feature)

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 provides the following integrated audio devices:

- [Recorder](recorder.md)
    
- [Player](player.md)
    
- [Tone controller](tonecontroller.md) for Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones and Fax tones

- [Speech recognition connector](speechrecognitionconnector.md) and [speech synthesis connector](speechsynthesisconnector.md)

Applications can use audio devices attached to media flows to implement scenarios such as the following:

- Use a **Player** object to play prerecorded prompts in an interactive voice response (IVR) application.

- Use a **Recorder** object to record messages or conversations in a call.

- Use a **ToneController** object to receive or send DTMF commands and perform actions on these DTMF commands, or to send or receive Fax tones.

- Use a **SpeechRecognitionConnector** object, in conjunction with the **Microsoft.Speech** namespace, to perform speech recognition.

- Use a **SpeechSynthesisConnector** object, in conjunction with the **Microsoft.Speech** namespace, to render text as speech.
