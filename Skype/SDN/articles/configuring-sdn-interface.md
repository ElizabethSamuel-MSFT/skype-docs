# Configure Skype for Business SDN Interface

 **Applies to**: Lync Server 2013 | Skype for Business 2015 | Skype for Business 2019

Skype for Business SDN Interface 2.2 and later supports three methods for configuring its components:
  
- Default configuration provided during the setup.

- Direct editing of the configuration files, DialogListener.exe.config and SDNManager.exe.config.

- By using the SDNManager.exe command line interface.

Most configuration settings provided during the setup are stored in each component's respective configuration file. In addition, the configuration files allow you to set more configuration settings, as well as to configure logging behavior. The remaining configuration settings can be edited using the command line interface.
